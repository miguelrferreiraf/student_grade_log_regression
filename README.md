## This project show how we can use less sophisticated models to obtain efficient predictions using Logistic Regression.

Hello, folks ðŸ‘‹.

In this project I'm gonna show that not all machine learning is neural network. We can obtain great results with less sophisticated models, that we learn as we begin to study machine learning. Here, you are going to be introduced to Decision Trees, a very simple model.
